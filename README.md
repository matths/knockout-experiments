# knockout experiments

knockout.js is a nice MVVM (Model View ViewModel) framework for easily binding values to DOM elements (View), with a small footprint, and is good for rapid prototyping.

## custom elements

It also enables the creation of custom html dom elements (close to web components) with the same kind of binding.

## my examples so far

I just started building a basic example. So far it offers insights two the following stuff:

* using custom elements
* creating elements with mode switching (view/edit)
* allow custom attributes (knockout.js itself offers just data-bind for components and params for custom elements attributes, only)

## applications using knockout.js

I have found that the skype web client is using knockout.js https://web.skype.com/. How cool is that? ;)
